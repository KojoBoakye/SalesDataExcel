## Goals and Purpose:

The primary goal of the "Sales Data Analysis" project was to identify and and gain valuable insights in a company's sales data to answer some stakeholder questions.

> The **ASK** Phase:

Stakeholder Questions to be answered.

1.	What are the top-selling products over the two-year period, 

2.	Can you identify any seasonality patterns in sales data for different product categories?

3.	What is the overall revenue generated from sales over the two-year period, and how does it vary by month and year?

4.	Are there any specific days of the week that tend to have higher sales volumes?

5.	What is the average profit margin for each product category, and how has it changed over the two years?

6.	How does the price elasticity of demand vary across different product categories, and how can this information be used to optimize pricing strategies?
